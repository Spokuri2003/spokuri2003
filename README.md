# Swathi Pokuri

I am an Electronics & Communication Engineering graduate currently focused on data science, machine learning, and quantitative analysis.  
My work emphasizes building structured, reliable analytical workflows and understanding patterns in real-world data — especially time-series and system-driven behavior.

I approach problems with an engineering mindset: breaking them down, modeling behavior, evaluating outcomes, and iterating with clarity and structure.

## What I Work On

- Machine learning & predictive modeling  
- Statistical analysis & data-driven inference  
- Time-series processing and behavior understanding  
- Quantitative analysis of financial and non-financial datasets  
- End-to-end workflows: data ingestion → feature design → modeling → evaluation  

I aim to build projects that reflect real-world scenarios rather than tutorials, with clean code and reproducible logic.

## Selected Work

### • Market Regime Classification (BTC-USD)  
An unsupervised approach to segmenting market behavior using statistical features and clustering.  
Includes diagnostics, regime characteristics, and performance evaluation.

*(Additional ML, analytics, and time-series projects will be added as I expand my portfolio.)*
