# Swathi Pokuri

Graduate student in Data Science, focusing on quantitative finance and systematic trading research. I am developing a strong foundation in statistical modeling, market microstructure, and data-driven portfolio analysis.

## Overview

My academic work and personal research are centered on understanding how market behavior can be quantified through data. I approach financial markets as complex, evolving systems influenced by volatility regimes, liquidity variation, and structural transitions.

I am particularly interested in:
- Statistical properties of returns
- Volatility dynamics
- Systematic signal construction
- Regime classification in financial time-series
- Risk-adjusted performance measurement

My goal is to develop analytical intuition and rigorous methods for extracting structure from noisy financial data.
