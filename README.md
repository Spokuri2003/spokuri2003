# Swathi Pokuri

I work on problems in data science, machine learning, and quantitative modeling, with a focus on building clear, reliable analytical pipelines.  
My interests lie in understanding patterns in complex datasets, modeling system behavior, and developing practical ML-driven solutions.

I enjoy working end-to-end — from data acquisition and feature design to modeling, evaluation, and interpretation — with an emphasis on clarity, structure, and reproducibility.
