# Swathi Pokuri

I work on data pipelines, modelling frameworks, and analytical tools built around real-world datasets.  
My work focuses on structure, reproducibility, and models that behave reliably under changing conditions.

## Projects

- *AI Market Crash Warning System*  
  Real-time analytics for volatility, sentiment, and regime behaviour.

- *Market Regime Classification (BTC)*  
  Unsupervised segmentation of market structure using engineered time-series features.

(More work will be added as I continue expanding the portfolio.)
